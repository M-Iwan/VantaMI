# [0.4.3]: 03-09-2026
[Added]
- PyPI release
- Renamed to VantaMI as NovaMI was taken on PyPI

# [0.4.2]: 21-08-2026

[Added]
- R-based repository called novami-r with code for Linear Mixed Models analyses
- More functions for flagging and filtering compounds
- New module: stats; so far with Mann-Whitney U-test
- New function for string distances

[Changed]
- tokenize_documents supports various filters (alpha, alnum, ascii) 

# [0.4.1]: 11-08-2026

[Added]
- Full update of the standardize module:
  - moved from pandas to polars
  - added support for parallel processing
  - added additional normalization step and reionize/unionize step
- Added function for deduplication of mixed censored/exact data (mad_censored_duplicates)
- Added more filtering options

# [0.4.0]: 22-04-2026

[Added]
- Finished cleaning up the novami.deep module; all classes, functions, and DL templates *should* work well with each other
- Partially missing documentation in the novami.deep.vectorizer and utils
- Unit test suite for molecular descriptors, distance calculations, partition, and data loading of deep module

[Fixed]
- Fixed the swapped GetFingerprintAsNumpy and GetCountFingerprintAsNumpy calls in smiles_2_* when a single SMILES string was passed
- Non-compatible Float32 assignment in outlier filter. Now uses Float64

[Removed]
- The remaining old code from the novami.deep module

# [0.3.5]: 01-04-2026

[Added]
- Extend functionality of group_k_neighbors_distance
- Add W.I.P. Winsorization to DataTransformer
- (Partially) clean the deep module
- ``MMDataset`` / ``MMBatch``, ``MMLoader``, and ``MMTUnit`` as the primary deep stack; legacy ``GNNRegressor`` and ``MMGV`` moved under ``deprecated/deep/`` with optional re-exports
- Calculations for Precision-Recall Curve AUC, Expected Calibration Error, Brier Score
- New QCG template for KFold-like calculations

[Fixed]
- The MAD deduplication procedure is now used

[Removed]
- A lot of old code from the novami.deep module
- ``vantami/deep/model.py`` (MMMTGNN and backbones); use ``deprecated/deep/mmmtgnn.py`` instead


# [0.3.4]: 25-02-2026

[Added]
- Added support for calculating distance distribution to self in data.distance.k_neighbors_distance
- Added wrapper around k_neighbors_distance that calculates them over groups: data.distance.group_k_neighbors_distance

[Fixed]
- Functions in data.descriptors now correctly parse provided < smiles_col > argument instead of setting it to "SMILES"

# [0.3.3]: 19-02-2026

[Added]
- Added support for parallel calculation of all available descriptors (except CDDD and Mordred)
- Added AtomPairs descriptors
- Added support for Count-variants of ECFP, Daylight and AtomPair fingerprints
[Changed]
- Slightly modified ml.augood module - the data is now transformed before clustering so that metrics like
cosine distance actually can work

## [0.3.2]: 18-02-2026

[Added]
- Completed the good_curve function in the ml.augood module - now fully integrated with the rest of
the repository!
- Support for Daylight path-based FPs and MAPC fingerprints
- Files needed for dataframe_2_klek are (well, should be) now automatically included!
- New manager for Train-Test splits (TTManager, data.manager)
- New method for KFoldManager: .get_non_test_data()
- New module: novami.utils for small and often used functions

[Changed]
- Files for data.descriptors now use .joblib instead of .pkl for better compatibility 
- DatasetManager renamed to KFoldManager to differentiate from TTManager
- Exposed read_pl and write_pl in novami.io module for easier imports
- Functions kf_evaluate and tt_evaluate in ml.evaluate now integrated with the rest of the code

[Removed]
- Old code in ml.evaluate

[Fixed]
- Missing parameter in RegressorAnalyzer

## [0.3.1]: 04-02-2026

[Added]
- New module: ml.augood:
  - good_curve (Generalization Out Of Distribution) curve using KFold evaluation

[Changed]
- Renamed data.similarity to data.distance (as all functions there were based on distance metrics anyway)
- Minor corrections and bug-fixes (missing imports, optional imports for some functions)

[Removed]
- Removed deprecated/visualize/ecdf.py
- Removed projects/drid (now available as separate repository at https://github.com/M-Iwan/CARBIDE)
- Removed data/process in favour of data/manipulate

## [0.3.0]: 29-01-2026
Public Release of the repository
